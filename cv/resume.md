dan-abstract: |
    A generalist software engineer with 10+ years' experience in security and privacy, I enjoy bug-hunting in low-level code and contributing to open-source software.
    Recently, I've developed private advertising technology in Chrome while working in Google's [Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com).
    Prior to that, I wrote bare-metal C for [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) and developed novel e2e testing infrastructure.
    I've contributed to IETF specifications in the TLS and DNS spaces by developing prototypes of draft revisions, which supported the evaluation of their feasibility and correctness.
    In the defense arena, I developed a PoC that generates VMs with unique calling conventions by modifying LLVM's X86 codegen and FreeBSD's kernel and userspace.
