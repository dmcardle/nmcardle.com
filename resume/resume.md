dan-abstract: |
    A generalist software engineer with 10+ years' experience in security and privacy, I enjoy designing and implementing new features, bug-hunting in low-level code, and contributing to open-source software.
    I currently work in Google's [Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com), where I've been building private advertising technology in Chrome.
    Before that, I wrote bare-metal C for [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/) and developed novel e2e testing infrastructure.
    I've contributed to IETF specifications in the TLS and DNS spaces by implementing prototypes of draft revisions in order to evaluate feasibility.
    In the defense arena, I authored a winning Phase II SBIR proposal and created a system based on FreeBSD and LLVM that generates VMs with unique calling conventions throughout their kernel and userspace.
